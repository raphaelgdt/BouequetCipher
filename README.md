==============

first attempt at webGL for Amy Ireland Bouequet

--- this is my first upload to gitHub ---
Cipher is a webGL page showcasing each phoneme/shape used in Amy Ireland's Bouequet 3D printed poems.
The main is a patchwork of different three.js scripts picked up online.
I'm currently in the process of optimizing the code for the following issues:
- improving geometry load to prevent empty display while new shapes are being loaded.
- cleaning up the code (var management, better function calls, correct indentation)
- creating nice UI to control speed, glitch amount, resolution, etc..
- allowing mobile device support.
- most importantly giving kudos to the many people I took code from!
